## 📝 Description

Zenith is an **Agentic AI Code Editor** that transforms software development by bridging the gap between traditional coding and autonomous intelligence. It solves the inefficiencies of manual boilerplate and context switching by seamlessly embedding **LangGraph** agents directly into your workflow to plan, execute, and verify to help you build just with natural language commands. Powered by **Google Gemini 1.5 Flash**, **Electron**, and **Python/Flask**, Zenith leverages **RAG** and **Tree-sitter** to provide a deeply context-aware environment that understands your code as well as you do ,along with effortless github actions integration and gamified algorithm visualizer for engineering grads to understand the working of algorithms in gamified way.

## 📦 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js** (v16+)
- **Python** (v3.10+)
- **Git**

### Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/trmore-1712/ZENITH-Code-Editor
    cd zenith-code-editor
    ```

2.  **Setup Backend**
    ```bash
    cd Zenith/JaiShreeRam/backend
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *Create a `.env` file in the `backend` folder:*
    ```env
    GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
    ```

3.  **Setup Frontend**
    ```bash
    cd ../frontend
    npm install
    ```

### Running the Application

1.  **Start the Backend Server**
    ```bash
    # In Zenith/JaiShreeRam/backend
    python app.py
    ```

2.  **Start the Editor**
    ```bash
    # In Zenith/JaiShreeRam/frontend
    npm start
    ```

## 🔮 Future Roadmap

- [ ] **Extension Marketplace**: A fully functional plugin system for community themes and tools.
- [ ] **Real-time Collaboration**: Google Docs-style live coding.
- [ ] **Multi-Model Support**: Switch between GPT-4, Claude, and Llama locally.

## 💸 Applications

1.  **Automated Refactoring**: Agents can handle large-scale generic refactors (e.g., "Migrate all print statements to logging").
2.  **Educational Tools**: The Algorithm Visualizer helps students understand complex logic visually.
3.  **Rapid Prototyping**: Generating boilerplate and basic logic via natural language speed up development.
