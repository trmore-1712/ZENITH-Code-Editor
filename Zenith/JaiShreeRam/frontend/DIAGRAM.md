# DIAGRAM.md - Placeholder for Architectural Diagrams

This file would contain architectural diagrams (e.g., System Context, Container, Component diagrams using PlantUML, Mermaid, or ASCII art) or detailed architectural notes, if the codebase files were provided for analysis.

**Reason for placeholder content:**
No codebase files were provided in the initial request, making it impossible to generate specific diagrams or architectural details.

**If codebase files are provided, this file would be populated with:**
*   High-level system context diagrams.
*   Container diagrams showing major technological components and their interactions.
*   Component diagrams for critical modules.
*   Detailed architectural explanations and design patterns identified within the codebase.
